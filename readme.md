# CHATBOT - NOT VERY SMART

A learning project - - - 

using python3 flask and chatterbot to make a trainable on demand chatbot
to train we should be sending it question|answer and it will know how to respond for that based
based on a 10% similarity of chatterbots Bestmatch logic adapter

on the front, it's tailwindcss along with PWA functionality and some fetch JS code to make it look 
native

next is deploying

options to explore tommrow:
- nGrok setup -- apprently it can SSL the site
- is the cache really working? - we are not asking it to cache in web.appmanifest
- run npx tailwindcss to update some stuff
- finalize the ui
- add some animations ... using what? :|
- fully optimize for pwa builder
- make the optimized boilerplate for flask

Lots of Flask PWA code reused from: https://github.com/umluizlima/flask-pwa - Thanks!
